While the idea of programming may be intimidating, modern tools and software have made it very accessible. For example, you may have had visions of strings of ones and zeros scrolling by Matrix fashion as you program, but the reality is that most of programming (particularly in data science) looks like constructing mathematical formulae using something approaching natural language.\n",

    "First, you can see that there really are two types of variables, continuous and categorical. Continuous features are those features that change continuously, like price or age of vehicle. These can take any value (even a negative number sometimes). Categorical features by contrast represent categories of items. An example of a categorical feature is the make of a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "You generally treat these two different kind of variables very different when building a model. Specifically, for categorical features, you can't give them directly to a model because the model expects numbers. Instead, you create a new feature that is a \"dummy variable\" for each realization of a category. For example, if we are thinking about the make of a car, one make might be Toyota. So, we would create a new variable called \"Make_Toyota\" and the value would be 1 for any car that was a Toyota and 0 for any car that was not a Toyota. This means that you really need to pay careful attention to which categorical variable you add into the model. Since there are 1041 different unique values for the Model of a car, if you add in this variable, you will be adding 1041 variables to your model. This can add a lot of columns to your data set very quickly.\n",

However, our data has lots of missing values (refer to the table where we summarized the data). We could throw out all rows with missing values, but that would mean throwing out 62,584 rows (see PRIMEUNIT). We could also drop any columns with missing values, but that would be most columns. Instead, we *impute* the missing values, where we fill in the values with something reasonable. For continuous features, we fill in the value with the mean value of everything else in the column.

    "One of the most important concepts for data science is the idea of \"out of sample\" testing. I.e., you have to test your model on data that it was not trained on. The models used by data scientists are incredibly powerful, and if you are not careful, the model can \"memorize\" the data set instead of uncovering true, robust patterns. This leads to something that data scientists call **overfitting**. The only way to test for overfitting is to split your data into two data sets: a *training set* which you use to train your model and a *testing set* which you only use to evaluate your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this naturally means that you have less data to train your model on, and generally speaking, models do better the more data they have to train on. However, the more testing data you have, the more confident you can be in the performance of your model. This sets up a natural tension between how much data you hold out for testing versus training. The below slider will let you choose the percentage of data to hold out for testing. Again, the fundamental tradeoff is the more data you hold out testing, the worse your best model is likely to be, but the more data you hold out for testing, the more likely you are to identify the best of (the slightly worse) models. How will you choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when you are testing your model, your final score will be much closer to the score you have on your testing set. However, the score will not be the same as that of your testing set because I have held out a third set of data that you do not have that will be used for the final validation. You will not know your true score until we run the competition in class, but it should be similar to your testing set score unless you use a really small test set."

    "Additionally, we have to choose what features our model will actually use. While you can choose all of the features, you may find that it \"overfits.\" We have roughly 70,000 rows of data and there are 2,410 columns after adding all of the dummies for the categorical variables. By selecting fewer variables, our model may be more robust to new data. Moreover, the more variables you pick, the longer it will take to train the models, and the less time you will have to tune the models. Do you go with more variables and less tuning time or less variables and more tuning time?"

    "A core concept in data science is *regularization*. The models used in data science are often very powerful, and if they are left unchecked they can memorize the data that they have seen. The problem with this is that any real data set has noise that is either a result of the data collection process or is just intrinsic to the system. If a model memorizes the data, then it ends up fitting the noise and not the true pattern. A common example is in the below image to the right. The true data generating process is the smooth line in the middle plot and some noise added, but if we overfit we can end up with a model that goes crazy trying to exactly match the pattern.\n",

    "The way to avoid overfitting is to *regularize* your model, i.e. set a parameter that restrains its ability to memorize the data set. Generally this either takes the form of a penalty for being \"too wavy\" or constrains the class of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However if you constrain your class of models too much, you end up *underfitting*, as seen in the image on the left above. To figure out where exactly you've landed, you need to pay careful attention to the model performance on the testing set."

    "A logistic regression is the cousin to the common linear regression that most of us are likely familiar with. The logistic regression instead of fitting a straight line, it fits a *sigmoid* function that relates the dependent variables to the probability that something is true, in this case whether or not a car IsBadBuy. The below image demonstrates this for a single dependent variable. Note that for larger values of *x*, there are more type 1 points, so the sigmoid goes up as x goes up.\n",

If you look at the coefficients, the size of a coefficient is related to the strength of the models response to a variable. Specifically, the coefficient indicates the change in probability of something happening for one standard deviation increase in that variable. So, a positive cofficient means that it makes it more likely for a car to be IsBadBuy, and a negative coefficient makes it less likely, at least as that variable goes up.\n",

    "A boosted trees model continues to extend on the basic decision tree. Basically, it is an iterated decision tree. First, you train a decision tree. Then you figure out what errors that decision tree made, and then train a second decision tree to correct the errors. To get your final prediction you take the prediction of the first tree and you add to it the prediction from the second tree (technically weighted by a learning rate described below). You can keep doing this as many times as you like with each iteration fixing the mistakes of the previous iterations. This concept is illustrated in the picture below where each tree (except for the first) fits the errors of the previous trees. Note that a \"tree\" here is just the step like function that predicts the variable (which is what a tree looks like when it is plotted).\n",

So, a lower value reduces overfitting, but a too low value can underfit.\n",
